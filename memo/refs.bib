abstract = {Given a graph G = (V,E) and a (not necessarily proper) edge-coloring of G, we consider the complexity of finding a spanning tree of G with as many different colors as possible, and of finding one with as few different colors as possible. We show that the first problem is equivalent to finding a common independent set of maximum cardinality in two matroids, implying that there is a polynomial algorithm. We use the minimum dominating set problem to show that the second problem is NP-hard.},

abstract = {Fix two lattice paths P and Q from (0,0) to (m, r) that use East and North steps with P never going above Q. We show that the lattice paths that go from (0,0) to (m, r) and that remain in the region bounded by P and Q can be identified with the bases of a particular type of transversal matroid, which we call a lattice path matroid. We consider a variety of enumerative aspects of these matroids and we study three important matroid invariants, namely the Tutte polynomial and, for special types of lattice path matroids, the characteristic polynomial and the β invariant. In particular, we show that the Tutte polynomial is the generating function for two basic lattice path statistics and we show that certain sequences of lattice path matroids give rise to sequences of Tutte polynomials for which there are relatively simple generating functions. We show that Tutte polynomials of lattice path matroids can be computed in polynomial time. Also, we obtain a new result about lattice paths from an analysis of the β invariant of certain lattice path matroids.},

abstract = {This paper studies structural aspects of lattice path matroids. Among the basic topics treated are direct sums, duals, minors, circuits, and connected flats. One of the main results is a characterization of lattice path matroids in terms of fundamental flats, which are special connected flats from which one can recover the paths that define the matroid. We examine some aspects related to key topics in the literature of transversal matroids and we determine the connectivity of lattice path matroids. We also introduce notch matroids, a minor-closed, dual-closed subclass of lattice path matroids, and we find their excluded minors.}
